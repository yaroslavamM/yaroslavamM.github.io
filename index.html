  <h3>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    <b>What is it?</b> This artifact is a mobile Android application designed for managing a list of events. Users can view existing events, add new events through a modal dialog, and delete events using a swipe gesture. Each event displays a title, description, and date.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>When was it created?</b> The initial version of this application was developed in the CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Why did you select this item?</b> I selected this Android application for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates a practical application of core Android development principles and showcases my ability to build interactive and user-friendly mobile interfaces. It covers fundamental concepts like UI design with XML, data management, user interaction, and the implementation of common mobile patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development?</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        UI/UX Implementation The use of RecyclerView for efficient list display, a FloatingActionButton for intuitive event creation, and an AlertDialog for the event input form demonstrates my ability to implement standard Android UI components to create a functional and user-friendly interface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data Handling and Adapters The creation of a custom EventAdapter to bind event data to the RecyclerView and the Event data class (in Kotlin/Java) showcases my understanding of data management and the adapter pattern crucial for list-based UIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        User Interaction Implementing click listeners for adding events and utilizing ItemTouchHelper with a custom SwipeToDeleteCallback to enable swipe-to-delete functionality highlights my skills in handling user input and gestures to create interactive experiences.
      </li>
      <li>
        Component Lifecycle Management. For the event app, this is less prominent but still present in Activity management.
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem Solving & Code Conversion The process of converting components from Java to Kotlin (or vice-versa if that was part of your journey) demonstrates adaptability and understanding of different programming paradigms within the Android ecosystem.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One?</b><br/>
    I made almost all the planned updates to the application, except for the filtering and sorting events functionality. After assessing the changes required to implement this functionality, I decided that it would take too many changes to the application and would exceed the scope of the planned improvements.
